# Reproducing Learned Policy Gradient by Oh et al., 2020

This repository contains part of the code developed by Juan Jose Garau Luis for his class project for MIT 6.883 Meta Learning. The objective of this part of the project was to reproduce part of the work from the paper [Discovering Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08794), by Oh et al., published in NeurIPS 2020. 

The following diagram created by Juan Jose Garau Luis shows an overview of the method from the original paper:
